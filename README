CRC Manifest Processor, Copyright (c) 2011 Richard Scott McNew.

This application handles the manual process of assigning
transportation hubs for incoming NPRs from the CRC.

The hub assignments are used to create ULNs needed to allocate
transportation assets so that the incoming NPRs can travel
quickly to their final destinations.
